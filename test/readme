Primitive DHT test for distroweb.

We have 3 peers:

ff0000, wantsTracker, knows about ff00ff and 0000fe (which doesn't exist)
  - hardcoded as Rose's computer (10.0.3.125)

ff00ff, mid, knows about ff0000, 0000ff, and 000000 (which doesn't exist)
  - hardcoded as Mindy's computer (10.0.3.226)

0000ff, hasTracker, knows about ff00ff and fe0000 (which doesn't exist)
  - hardcoded as Andree's computer (10.0.3.98)


To run the test:

1)  clone the repo (git://github.com/sudowhoami/distroweb.git) onto 3 computers.

2)  decide which computer will serve each role (wantsTracker, middleman, and hasTrackerination).

3)  edit the test/******Peers.json files to include the proper ip addresses.  

4)  in the distroweb folder of each computer, create a symlink called peers that points to the appropriate test Peers file

5)  on the wantsTracker computer, ln -s test/dhtTestTracker source/ff0002

6)  run the DHT server (node test/dhtServer.js) on all the computers

7)  run test/dhtRequest.js on the hasTrackerination computer

8)  if it didn't work, please email us with the details.  If it did, GROVEL BEFORE OUR MIGHTY DHT, PEASANT

9)  thanks :)
